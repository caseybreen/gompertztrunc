  Found the following files/directories:
    'lastMiKTeXException'

0 errors ✓ | 0 warnings ✓ | 2 notes x

Notes:
* The 'lastMiKTeXException' note only occurs when build is checked on windows-x86_64-devel. After searching online, it seems that this note is possibly due to a MiKTeX bug during checking and can probably be ignored.
