<!-- ## TODO  -->

<!-- 1. Implement option for  discrete (integer) and continuous death ages. (later) -->

<!--2. Check if CI is correct. Casey thinks the confidence intervals are probably anti-conservative, e.g. coverage ratio of the "95% intervals" is probably closer to 70%.  -->

<!-- 3. Include way to specify structure of "b," e.g. different for men and women, or smooth function of cohort or ... (Later) -->

<!-- 4. Fixed effects (Later) -->
