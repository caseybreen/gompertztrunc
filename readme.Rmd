# gompertztrunc 

## About the package -- in progress

`gompertztrunc` is a package for R for estimating Gompertz distributions from doubly-truncated data using maximum likelihood estimation.


## TODO 

1. Apply to real data (e.g., BUNMD) or one of Censoc datasets. The `gompertz_mle` function seems to work okay on a simple DMF dataset â€” but BUNMD or Numident is a better test. 

2. Get `gompertz_mle` function to work with weights. 

3. More flexible functions for estimating e65 (using MLE gompertz parameters OR baseline )

4. Double-check that code works with both discrete (integer) and continuous death ages. 

5. Check if CI is correct. Casey thinks the confidence intervals are probably anti-conservative, e.g. coverage ratio of the "95% intervals" is probably closer to 70%. 

6. Include way to specify structure of "beta," e.g. different for men and women, or smooth function of cohort or ... (Later)

7. Fixed effects (Later)
