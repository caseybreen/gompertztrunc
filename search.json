Now let’s try running gompertz_mle() function simulated data: gompertz_mle() function returns list contains three elements: initial starting parameters MLE routine. Unless specified user, starting parameter found using OLS regression age death. full optim object, gives details optimization routine (e.g., whether model converged). data.frame containing results: estimated Gompertz parameters, coefficients, hazards ratios 95% confidence intervals. recommend always checking full optim object make sure model converged. first row gives estimated Gompertz \\(b\\) parameter, second row gives Gompertz mode. next three rows show covariate’s estimated coefficient associated hazard ratio. hazard ratio compares ratio hazard rate population strata (e.g., treated group) population baseline (.e., control group). hazard ratio 1 suggests higher risk ages hazard ratio 1 suggests smaller mortality risk ages (assuming proportional hazards). Let’s compare estimated values true value. can simulated (fake) data. investigators likely report hazard ratios, translating hazard ratios differences life expectancy may help facilitate interpretation comparison studies. included functionality gompertztrunc package convert_hazards_to_ex() function:","code":"## Look at simulated data  head(sim_data) ##      aod byear dyear       temp   sex isSouth ##    <num> <int> <num>      <num> <num>   <num> ## 1:    87  1810  1897 -4.6198501     1       0 ## 2:    78  1810  1888 -0.8841613     1       0 ## 3:    79  1810  1890  0.7566703     1       0 ## 4:    85  1810  1895 -0.6728037     1       0 ## 5:    85  1810  1896 -3.8537981     1       0 ## 6:    81  1810  1891 -1.2885393     1       0 ## What years do we have mortality coverage?  sim_data %>%    summarize(min(dyear), max(dyear)) ##   min(dyear) max(dyear) ## 1       1888       1905 ## run gompertz_mle function   ## returns a list  simulated_example <- gompertz_mle(formula = aod ~ temp + as.factor(sex) + as.factor(isSouth),                                                  left_trunc = 1888,                                                  right_trunc = 1905,                                                  data = sim_data) ## 1. starting value for coefficients (from linear regression) simulated_example$starting_values ##         log.b.start            b0.start                temp     as.factor(sex)1  ##         -2.30258509         -9.96897213          0.07505734         -0.18001387  ## as.factor(isSouth)1  ##          0.22607193 ## 2. optim fit object simulated_example$optim_fit ## $par ##         log.b.start            b0.start                temp     as.factor(sex)1  ##          -2.2745186          -9.4083999           0.2068584          -0.5300299  ## as.factor(isSouth)1  ##           0.5983461  ##  ## $value ## [1] 17549.16 ##  ## $counts ## function gradient  ##      886       NA  ##  ## $convergence ## [1] 0 ##  ## $message ## NULL ##  ## $hessian ##                     log.b.start  b0.start       temp as.factor(sex)1 ## log.b.start           283845.66 35822.202 -36549.785       20205.368 ## b0.start               35822.20  4536.154  -4552.676        2553.982 ## temp                  -36549.79 -4552.676  32378.684       -1569.926 ## as.factor(sex)1        20205.37  2553.982  -1569.926        2553.949 ## as.factor(isSouth)1    14017.01  1783.017  -3199.463        1109.978 ##                     as.factor(isSouth)1 ## log.b.start                   14017.009 ## b0.start                       1783.017 ## temp                          -3199.463 ## as.factor(sex)1                1109.978 ## as.factor(isSouth)1            1783.000 ## 2. check model convergence (0 == convergence) simulated_example$optim_fit$convergence ## [1] 0 ## 3.
